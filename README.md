# Spam Email Detector using NLP and Machine Learning
This project implements a Spam Message Classification System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning & deep learning models including:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection dataset which contains labeled SMS messages as ham (not spam) or spam.

# Project Highlights
Text preprocessing and vectorization using TF-IDF and Tokenizer

Training and evaluating five different models

Accuracy comparison using Seaborn bar plot

Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
